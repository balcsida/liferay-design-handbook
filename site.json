Why we do it? Feedback is an important tool for improving work and make the design and designers better. It also help us to get aligned as a team, to see things through others perspective, to share knowledge, identify opportunities and to foster a culture of collaboration. How it works 1. When The meeting happens on demand, but we booked a set schedule on Wednesdays for this moment. 2. Rules Max. 2 projects per session Each presentation may take up to 1h Max. 5 participants (considering facilitator, note taker and critiques) Token 15min presentation 5min feedback per person 3. Roles The presenter must clearly articulate on the problem he/she is trying to solve. Before showing his project, answer these questions: Why problem is the design trying to solve? Who is the target user? Why is it important to solve this problem for the use? Why is it important for the business to solve this problem? What kind of feedback he wants from critics? The mediator will make sure the meeting will run happily on time and and keep everyone focused on the purpose of the meeting. The note taker will take notes on the feedbacks. The critics must provide feedbacks related to the problem and suggest alternate approaches. This article talks about interesting method of giving feedbacks through questions 4. Rounds Since there might be up to 2 presentations per meeting, each round will cover 1 project and will consider the following steps. Opening: the session starts with the facilitator explaining the rules; Presentation: up to 15min; Feedbacks: 5min per critique / up to 30min total; Wrap-up: the facilitator makes sure all feedbacks are clarified and points if there is need for further discussion. 5. Materials and tools For the room: paper, pencil, timer, TV; For the presentation: laptop, InVision, Figma; Water, coffee and snacks Good Practices For everything to happen well and the meeting to be positive, we have created some good practices. Be respectful; Encourage constructive criticism; Be positive and congratulate good work; Be empathetic; Be on time; Organize your work before the meeting; Use the sandwich feedback method; Personal feedback, after the meeting; Don't try to design in the meeting; Don't provide feedback out of script; Avoid parallel conversation; Don't take it personal. And lastly, an image that represents how well we should behave when receiving feedbacks.

Sprints let your team reach clearly defined goals and deliverables and gain key learnings, quickly. The process helps spark innovation, encourage user-centered thinking, align your team under a shared vision, and get you to product launch faster. Phases Before the Design Sprint, prepare by picking the proper team, environment, materials and tools. 1. Understand Discover the business opportunity, the audience, the competition, the value proposition, and define metrics of success. 2. Diverge Explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility. 3. Converge Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding. 4. Prototype Design and prepare prototype(s) that can be tested with people. 5. Test Conduct user testing with people from the product's primary target audience. Ask good questions. Deliverables The main deliverables after the Design sprint: Findings from the sprint (notes, user journey maps, storyboards, information architecture diagrams, etc.) Prototypes Report from the user testing with the findings (backed by testing videos) A plan for next steps Resources For more content about Design Sprint: Design Sprint kit Google Design Sprint ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/design-ops/design-sprint.md","id":"design-sprint","location":"/docs/design-ops/design-sprint.html","url":"/docs/design-ops/design-sprint.html"},"lexicon":{"title":"Lexicon","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.description} What is Lexicon Lexicon is a design language created with the aim of providing a common framework for building interfaces within the Liferay product ecosystem.

In order for the company and its employees to continue growing, we divide the year into quarters, where we make an evaluation and create goals for every 3 months. Besides the company and leaders accompanying the growth of the employee, he will also self-evaluate. How it works Every 3 months the manager will schedule a review meeting, whether it lasts an average of 3 hours. And in this meeting we will cover 5 topics. 1. Personal Needs & Goals In this first step the employe will tell yours personal needs and goals, and how liferay is helping in this development process. The questions asked are: Being truly honest, are you happy at Liferay? How are you feeling in working for Liferay? Speaking in short and long-term periods, what are your aspirations? Is Liferay providing a context that is compatible with your needs and goals? What would make you leave Liferay today? What do you think Liferay or your manager could do for supporting you? 2. Expectations In this step, the employee will think about the expectations he has for himself, the team and the manager. The questions that should be answered: What expectations do you have for yourself? Considering your position. What expectations do you think the team has over you? What expectations do you think your managers has over you? What expectations do you have regarding your team? What expectations do you have regarding your managers? What expectations do you have regarding the organization? 3. Performance review In this step, the employee will self-assess in 5 aspects, and the evaluation is: From -3 to -1 = is not meeting expectations, and something is wrong. This case can happen either for personal reasons or not. 0 = meets basic expectations 1 = meets most expectations 2 = meets all expectations 3 = exceeds all expectations. For each note given, it is necessary to contain the facts on which it is based and what the objectives are for it to be improved. The 5 aspects are: Does he/she have knowledge and experience? Does he/she do quality work? Is he/she reliable? Is he/she a good communicator? Does he/she bring positive energy and a heart to serve? 4. Agreement In this moment, the leader and employer can re-read the performance review for selecting the goals the person will pursue on the next quarter. 5. Motivators Motivators are cards with various characteristics that involve the corporate world, such as collaboration, feedback, technique, speed, recognition ... where the employee will select the 10 that matter most to him at that moment, placing them in order of priority. Follow up The follow up is a weekly meeting with the manager to follow the goals and objectives set for that quarter, always proposing small activities during the week and the months to reach them.

Not all projects need to have all these boards, they can be added over time. 1. Overview This is where you put brief descriptions of what the project is about, short and long term goals, team members, and more. An example of the Forms project. 2. Benchmark Where we gather screens, and all the information of our main committers. A good practice is to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of how they solve that problem. 3. Heuristics On this board, we do a product analysis as it currently stands. You can build on 10 heuristics for user interface by Jacob Nielsen. 4. Links All search links, articles related to that project or features that it has. 5. Information Architecture You can build the architecture of your project through cards and notes. 6. Branding Where you organize all the information and actions that the user and the system will do, being able to categorize and group, helping to build the interface. 7.

Plugins Sketch has several plugins that help and optimize our work, here is a list of the most used in Liferay, what they serve and where you can find them. Artboard Tricks: Automatically rearranges your artboards Auto Layout: Design responsive screens in Sketch and publish to HTML Craft: Craft is a suite of plugins to let you design with real data in mind. Find and Replace: Finds text in selected layer(s) and all layers contained within - and replaces it with different text. Nudg.it: Nudg.it is a simple app that allows you to quickly edit these settings on the fly. Rename it: Rename layers and artboards automatically Runner: Quickly search through all available plugins and Sketch menu commands. Sketch: Shortcuts to increase productivity Symbol Organizer: Organize your symbols page, and layer list, alphabetically and into groupings determined by your symbol names. Sketch Translate: Translate your artboards to different languages. Directly from your Sketch file. Content Generator: Quickly create dummy data such as avatars, names, geolocation data etc. Magic Mirror: Add Perspective Transformation to Sketch Layers Organization In Sketch, we also have an organization of the layers, so that it facilitates the subsequent editing of both the designer who did and others who can work on it. 1. Order The order is always decreasing. Sketch automatically saves each new layer created above, but you should always rearrange when creating something new. You can use the Artboard Tricks plugin to rearrange it more quickly. And with each screen of the stream you are creating, list it in descending order. 2. Naming For each layer the naming must have: 01-current-page-(action-element) Examples: 01-home-(scrolled) 02-profile-edit-(hover-save-button) ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/design-tools/sketch.md","id":"sketch","location":"/docs/design-tools/sketch.html","url":"/docs/design-tools/sketch.html"}},"childIds":["sketch","invision","milanote"]},"getting-started":{"children":{"acess-and-licenses":{"title":"Access and Licenses","layout":"guide","weight":3,"content":" {$page.description} Passwords Configuration Define your computer password with the same password of wifi.
